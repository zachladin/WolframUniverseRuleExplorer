# WolframUniverseRuleExplorer
Tiny Universe Explorer

This Mathematica notebook must be run in Mathematica (version 12.1), and is a basic template for automating the search and
visualization of potentially interesting rules related to the Wolfram Physics Project (https://www.wolframphysics.org/).
You will need to first set the correct filepaths for your local machine, and then should be able to simulate the early
evolution of tiny universes using randomly-generated simple-ruled networks.
